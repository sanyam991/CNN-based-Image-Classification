# 🧠 CNN-Based Image Classification

A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates image classification using a CNN. The model is trained to classify images from the [Dataset Name] into multiple categories.

## 📂 Dataset

- Dataset: Cat and Dog // Car vs Bike
- Source: kaggle.com
- Classes: 

## 🏗️ Architecture

Basic CNN structure:
- Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPooling
- Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPooling
- Flatten → Dense → Output

## 🧪 Results

- Accuracy: 90%
- Loss: 10%
- Confusion Matrix, Accuracy/Loss Graphs are available in the notebook.
